    AngularJS is a framework for web development created and supported by Google. By using the 
        <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Control Architecture</a> 
    to organize itself, AngularJS modularizes and isolates the iteractings components of web applications. AngularJS prescribes
    a certain design; we must think in terms of Models, Views and Controllers. In AngularJS, a HTML template provides a <i>View</i> 
    of a data <i>Model</i>. This interaction occurs through a <i>Controller</i>.

    <div class = "note">
        In other words, <b>Views</b> <i>plug</i> into <b>Controllers</b> so they can access and present the <b>Models</b> to the user.
    </div>
