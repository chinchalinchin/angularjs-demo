<h2>1: Dependency Injection</h2>
    <div class = 'example-box'>
        <div class='tab'> Here is an HTML element containing the <i>ng-controller</i> directive.<br><br>
            The <i>ng-controller'</i> directive allows you to pass directly from the View into the Model by accessing the Controller.
            If you click <i>F12</i> on your keyboard and open the <i>Network tab</i> on the Developer console, you will see a script 
            <i>example_controller.js</i> being served up to your browser. This script contains the data being injected into the View.
            Take a look at the <i>Response</i> in the Developer console to see how this accomplished. Notice the name of function
            in the Response exactly equals the name of this HTML element. This is no coincidence! This is how AngularJS knows
            to bind the Controller into this element!<br><br>

            <div class = "tab">
                <i>Technically, it is the <b>$scope</b> passed an argument into the controller that opens a channel through the Controller from 
                    the Model to the View</i>
            </div><br>
            We use the Controller data injection inside of another Angular directive, the <i>ng-repeat</i> directive to illustrate
            the potential use for this type of functionality.
        </div>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <div class = 'tab'>
            <table class = "tab">
                    <col width = "200">
                    <tr><td><u><b>This Is For Coding</b></u></td> <td><u><b>This is For Fun</b></u></td></tr>
                    <tr ng-repeat = "ooms in mantra">
                        <td>{{ooms.coding | uppercase }}</td> <td>{{ooms.fun | lowercase}}</td></li>
                    </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
    </div>
