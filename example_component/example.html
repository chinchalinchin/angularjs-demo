        <h1><u>AngularJS Demo</u><br></h1>
        <p>AngularJS uses the 
            <a href = "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/angularjs/angularjs_mvc_architecture.htm">Model-View-Control Architecture</a> 
            to implement its design and functionality. In AngularJS, a HTML template provides a <i>View</i> of a data <i>Model</i>. 
            This interaction is overseen by a <i>Controller</i>.
            <div class = "tab">
                <i>In other words, <b>Views</b> "plug" into <b>Controllers</b> so they can access and present the <b>Models</b> to the user.</i>
            </div>

        <h1>AngularJS Dictionary</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><a href = "">Directive</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h1>AngularJS Functionality</h1>
        <h2>1: Data Binding</h2>
        <div>

        </div><br><br>

        <h2>2: Dependency Injection</h2>
        <div ng-controller="ExampleController" class='example-box'> Here is an HTML element containing the <i>ng-controller</i> directive.<br><br>
            A <i>directive</i> is a special type of AngularJS object. It gives HTML classes a new functionality over and above vanilla
            CSS-styling. The <i>ng-controller'</i> directive allows you to inject data from Models into the View by accessing the Controller.
            If you click <i>F12</i> on your keyboard and open the <i>Network tab</i> on the Developer console, you will see a script 
            <i>example_controller.js</i> being served up to your browser. This script contains the data being injected into the View.
            Take a look at the <i>Response</i> in the Developer console to see how this accomplished. Notice the name of function
            in the Response exactly equals the name of this HTML element. This is no coincidence! This is how AngularJS knows
            to inject the Controller into this element!<br><br>

            <div class = "tab">
                <i>Technically, it is the <b>$scope</b> passed an argument into the controller that opens a channel through the Controller from the 
                    Model to the View</i>
            </div><br>
            We use the Controller data injection inside of another Angular directive, the <i>ng-repeat</i> directive to illustrate
            the potential use for this type of functionality.
